              Glencarrig is right in the centre of the Loop Head Peninsula which
              was voted the Best Place to Holiday in Ireland by the Irish Times

              Be it Fishing, Dolphin watching, Walking, Cycling, Horse riding
              and Water sports it’s all available. There are also lovely places
              to swim or just lie in the sun and take in the views. Our local
              village is an old fishing village which has two piers on the lower
              Shannon Estuary. The village has a Shop, a Post Office and 4 Pubs!
              All of them have live music at times and one of them, the Long
              Dock has won awards for its food. Indeed in 2015 it was voted

              distance of Carrigaholt and we are always ready to give you a lift
              there or back. Some useful web sites of local businesses if you

              Glencarrig is just over a mile (2km) from the village of
              Carrigaholt in the centre of the Loop Head Peninsula and is
              signposted from the village. Carrigaholt is on the Wild Atlantic
              Way and about 7 minutes direct drive from Kilkee. Shannon Airport
              is the nearest Airport and about an hour and a quarter away.
              Dublin and Cork airports are just over 3 hours driving away. You
              can plan your route on the attached map but our county town is
              Ennis which is well served by a fine motorway the M18. If you are
              driving from Limerick, Dublin or Cork you will be coming north on
              this road or if driving from Galway you will be heading south. In
              any case you take exit 12 onto the N85 which is signed posted for
              Ennis and Kilrush. After this exit you pick up the N68 to Kilrush
              and then the N 67 to Kilkee. From Kilkee you pick up the signs for
              Loop Head and Carrigaholt. There is a Train service to Ennis and a
              Bus service to Kilkee but no public transport west of that. We can
              arrange a pick up for you from Kilkee if required.

              <p>
                Carrigaholt is an ideal harbour to go deep sea fishing from.
                Being in an estuary it is possible to go fishing in all weather
                conditions and can provide a relaxing days fishing in shallow
                bays. The Estuary can produce excellent Ray fishing, double
                figure Bull Huss, flat fish like Plaice, Dab and Turbot, and in
                season is one of the best places to fish for Tope in Ireland.
                Because its waters are so nutrient rich the estuary is also home
                to many Bottle Nose Dolphins and these lovely creatures often
                pay us a visit on our way to the fishing grounds.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                As you head out to Loop head you will have time to take in the
                wonderful scenery. The north side of the estuary is bordered by
                low cliffs that are of great interest to geologists and the
                magnificent view of Mount Brandon rises in front of you. At the
                end of the peninsula you are starting to get into the best
                fishing grounds to be found in Ireland.<br />

                Carrigaholt, (translation: ‘Rock of the Fleet’) is a picturesque
                fishing village on the southern side of Loop Head, about 10
                kilometres southwest of Kilkee. Set within an important
                ecological environment, the village lies at the mouth of the
                Moyarta river, which flows into the Mouth of the Shannon about
                15 kilometres from the westernmost extremity of the peninsula.
                The village has an attractive centre, with distinctive
                streetscapes and quaint local character, and several pubs and
                restaurants. The harbour, the church (built 1882-1883) and, most
                important, the ruins of Carrigaholt Castle are the most
                distinctive local landmarks. Carrigaholt also boasts a safe,
                sandy beach for swimming and water sports. The most stunning
                landmarks around Carrigaholt:
