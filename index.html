            Glencarrig is right in the centre of the Loop Head Peninsula which
            was voted the Best Place to Holiday in Ireland by the Irish Times in
            2013. For the outdoor enthusiast there is just so much to do. Be it
            Fishing, Dolphin watching, Walking, Cycling, Horse riding and Water
            sports it’s all available. There are also lovely places to swim or
            just lie in the sun and take in the views. Our local village is an
            old fishing village which has two piers on the lower Shannon
            Estuary. The village has a Shop, a Post Office and 4 Pubs! All of
            them have live music at times and one of them, the Long Dock has won
            awards for its food. Indeed in 2015 it was voted Irelands food pub
            of the year. Glencarrig is well within walking distance of
            Carrigaholt and we are always ready to give you a lift there or
            back. Some useful web sites of local businesses if you are planning

            Glencarrig is just over a mile (2km) from the village of Carrigaholt
            in the centre of the Loop Head Peninsula and is signposted from the
            village. Carrigaholt is on the Wild Atlantic Way and about 7 minutes
            direct drive from Kilkee. Shannon Airport is the nearest Airport and
            about an hour and a quarter away. Dublin and Cork airports are just
            over 3 hours driving away. You can plan your route on the attached
            map but our county town is Ennis which is well served by a fine
            motorway the M18. If you are driving from Limerick, Dublin or Cork
            you will be coming north on this road or if driving from Galway you
            will be heading south. In any case you take exit 12 onto the N85
            which is signed posted for Ennis and Kilrush. After this exit you
            pick up the N68 to Kilrush and then the N 67 to Kilkee. From Kilkee
            you pick up the signs for Loop Head and Carrigaholt. There is a
            Train service to Ennis and a Bus service to Kilkee but no public
            transport west of that. We can arrange a pick up for you from Kilkee
            if required.

          Glencarrig B&B has 4 guest bedrooms. All are spacious and are ensuite.
          3 of the bedrooms are upstairs and 2 of these have a double and single
          bed and 1 has a double bed. Downstairs there is also a twin bedroom
          with 2 single beds. All the bedrooms are supplied with hairdryers and
          TV’s as you would expect, but what is a definitive plus is the
          fantastic views out over the Shannon estuary, Kilcredaun point and the
          Kerry Mountains. Waking up to such views just never gets boring!
          Downstairs there is a Guest Lounge that opens out onto the Garden and
          Patio which is a lovely place to sit on a good evening. There is also
          a games room with a full sized Pool Table and Tea and Coffee making
          facilities. There is a drying area for any wet coats and Wi Fi is of
          course available free to all our guests. If you have young children we
          will be happy to set up an extra bed in your room for them or if you
          have any other requirements please do ask.
